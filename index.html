      First publication to Github

    <p>If you're reading this, Github is easy to hack, just be sure to never commit more than what you're sure you can commit every day</p>
    <p>Because, if you commit a number that is too high, say, highest commit=8, 8 automatically becomes your deep green, and the next number lower that it, becomes the slightly lighter one</p>
    <So it's advicable to never commit more than 3 times in a day, when you're just starting github, and carry on like that forerver</p>
